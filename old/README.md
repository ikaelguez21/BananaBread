recent problems:

3. the code is very bulky and rely heavily on the large csv files
4. when i add new course with pre courses and select the right courses they dont show as connected to each other
5. also lets take course number 01040294 for example, when i try to add it the interface shows me that i can choose two
   prerequisete(idk how to spell it), but when chosen one the other still showns, when the right logic is that i can
   shoose one or the other
6. idk how to minimize the csv files
7. some coursse show only as the course id
8. got some feedback about the UI
9. when single course is shown twice because u need to do it twice in the degree and checking one as done the other one
   is also checked
10. 03940901 is supposed to be listed as חינוך גופני. all the PE classes need a re workd
