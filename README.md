recent problems:
1. course selecting inside each semester
2. i want the course 'line' be more understandable 
3. the code is very bulky and rely heavily on the large csv files
4. when i add new course with pre courses and select the right courses they dont show as connected to each other
5. also lets take course number 01040294 for example, when i try to add it the interface shows me that i can choose two prerequisete(idk how to spell it), but when chosen one the other still showns, when the right logic is that i can shoose one or the other
6. idk how to minimize the csv files
7.
